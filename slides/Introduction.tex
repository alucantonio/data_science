		\begin{itemize}
			\item Arthur Samuel (1959). Machine learning is a “Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed”.
			\item Tom Mitchell (1998). “A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E”.

		\frametitle{Data}
		Data captures the structure of the problem.
		
		\vspace{5mm}
		
		The data instances are called \textbf{samples} and each sample has different \textbf{attribute} values. The kind and the number of attribute is common for each sample. We will see two types of attributes
		
		
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Continuous attributes (real numbers).
			\item Categorical (or discrete) attributes (integers). 
		\end{itemize}
	
		\vspace{5mm}
		
		Preprocessing: prepare and manipulate data to make them suitable for the model.
	\end{frame}
	

	\begin{frame}
		\frametitle{Tasks - Supervised Learning}
		The task is the purpose of the application.
		
		\vspace{5mm}
		
		In \textbf{supervised learning}, a dataset of input-output relations is provided.
		The learning is supervised because we already know how the current looks like.
		
		Two type of supervised learning problems:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Regression}. Predict results within a continuous output.
			
			Example: Predict the price of an house given its size.
			\item \textbf{Classification}.  Predict results within a discrete output (categorical data).
			
			Example: Given an email, predict if it is spam or not (\textsl{binary classification})

	\begin{frame}
		\frametitle{Tasks- Unsupervised Learning}
		In \textbf{unsupervised learning}, we have no idea how the output looks like (unlabeled data). We have to derive structure and different relationships from data.
		
		Examples:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Take a collection of essays and find a way to automatically group them based on word frequency, sequence length, page counts etc.
			\item Recommender systems. Automatically provide suggestions for an item
			that is most pertinent to a particular user.
		\end{itemize}

	\begin{frame}
		\frametitle{Model}
		Main goal: describe data relationships through a language
		
		\vspace{5mm}
		
		Hypotheses: a candidate model for the task.
		
		Hypotheses space: the class of hypotheses that the learning algorithm (see later) can produce.
		
		\vspace{5mm}
		
		No free lunch theorem (idea): it does not exist a universal best learning method.
	\end{frame}

	\begin{frame}
		\frametitle{Learning algorithm}
		Based on: data, task and model.
		
		\vspace{5mm}
		
		Search method: find the best hypothesis in the hypothesis space.
		
		\vspace{5mm}
		
		Best hypothesis means ''minimum error''. The error function is called \textsl{cost function} (or \textsl{loss function}).
		
		\vspace{5mm}
		
		Crucial: the aim is \textsl{generalize} and NOT \textsl{fitting}. We want to avoid models which performs extremely good on our data and poorly on unseen data (overfitting).
