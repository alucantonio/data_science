		\begin{itemize}
			\item Arthur Samuel (1959). Machine learning is a “Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed”.
			\item Tom Mitchell (1998). “A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E”.
		\end{itemize}

	(a) Labelling different entities in a given image. 
	
	(b) Face recognition (as in our smartphones).

		Using e.g. image recognition, companies are building self-driving cars increasingly efficient.

	"AlphaGo is the first computer program to defeat a professional human Go player, the first to defeat a Go world champion, and is arguably the strongest Go player in history."

		\frametitle{Supervised Learning}
		In \textbf{supervised learning}, a dataset of input-output relations is provided.
		The learning is supervised because we already know how the current looks like.
		
		Two type of supervised learning problems:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Regression}. Predict results within a continuous output.
			
			Example: Predict the price of an house given its size.
			\item \textbf{Classification}.  Predict results within a discrete output (categorical data).
			
			Example: Given an email, predict if it is spam or not (\textsl{binary classification})
		\end{itemize}
	\end{frame}

	\begin{frame}
		\frametitle{Unsupervised Learning}
		In \textbf{unsupervised learning}, we have no idea how the output looks like (unlabeled data). We have to derive structure and different relationships from data.
		
		Examples:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Take a collection of essays and find a way to automatically group them based on word frequency, sequence length, page counts etc.
			\item Recommender systems. Automatically provide suggestions for an item
			that is most pertinent to a particular user.
