		\frametitle{What is Machine Learning?}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Arthur Samuel (1959). Machine learning is a “Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed”.
			\item Tom Mitchell (1998). “A computer program is said to learn from experience \textit{E} with respect to some class of tasks \textit{T} and performance measure \textit{P}, if its performance at tasks in \textit{T}, as measured by \textit{P}, improves with experience \textit{E}”.

	Two examples of image recognition. 
	
	(a) Labelling different entities in a given image. 
	
	(b) Face recognition (as in our smartphones).

		\frametitle{Some applications - Speech and voice recognition}
		Speech recognition involves recording words using a recording device. The audio is then converted into a set of words stored digitally within the device or program. Instead, the purpose of voice recognition is to identify the person who is speaking.

	(c) A general idea of speech recognition. 
	
	(d) Google’s voice assistant provide individualized responses (e.g. calendar updates or reminders) only to the users who trained the assistant to recognize their voices.

		\frametitle{Data}
		A \textbf{sample} (or example) is a collection of \textbf{attributes} (or features) that have been quantitatively measured from some object or event that we want the ML system to process.
		
		\vspace{5mm}
		
		
		A \textbf{dataset} is a collection of many samples.
		
		\begin{figure}
			\centering
			\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{images/data-example}
		\end{figure}
		
		
		We will see two types of attributes
		
		
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Continuous attributes (real numbers).
			\item Categorical (or discrete) attributes (integers). 
		\end{itemize}
	\end{frame}

	\begin{frame}
		\frametitle{Data - Preprocessing}
		Preprocessing: prepare and manipulate data to make them suitable for the model.
		
		Why Preprocessing:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Data cleaning}. Identifying and correcting inconsistencies in the data.
			\item \textbf{Data transformation}. Converting the data into a suitable format
			\item \textbf{Data reduction}. Reducing the size of the dataset preserving as much as you can the important information
			\item \textbf{Data Normalization}. Scaling the data to a common range (usually between 0 and 1 or -1 and 1).
		\end{itemize}
	\end{frame}
	

	\begin{frame}
		\frametitle{Tasks - Supervised Learning}
		The task is the purpose of the application.
		
		\vspace{5mm}
		
		\textbf{Supervised learning} consitutes of task where the dataset contains features, but each example is also associated with a \textbf{target} (also called label).
		
		The term supervised learning originates from the view of the target being provided by an instructor or teacher who shows the ML system what to do.
		
		Two type of supervised learning problems:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Regression}. Predict results within a continuous output.
			
			Example: Predict the price of an house given its size.
			\item \textbf{Classification}.  Predict which categories/classes the input belongs to (categorical data).
			
			Example: Given an email, predict if it is spam or not (\textsl{binary classification})
		\end{itemize}

	\begin{frame}
		\frametitle{Tasks- Unsupervised Learning}
		\textbf{Unsupervised learning} tasks experience a dataset containing many features, then learn useful properties of the structure of this dataset (\textbf{unlabeled data}). In other terms, we have to derive structure and different relationships from data.
		
		Examples:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Take a collection of essays and find a way to automatically group them based on word frequency, sequence length, page counts etc.
			\item Recommender systems. Automatically provide suggestions for an item
			that is most pertinent to a particular user.
		\end{itemize}

	\begin{frame}
		\frametitle{Model}
		A \textbf{model} is an abstract representation of a system using mathematical concepts. In the present context, the model operates on data to solve the task.
		
		\vspace{5mm}
		
		Hypotheses: a candidate model for the task.
		
		Hypotheses space: the class of hypotheses that the learning algorithm (see later) can produce.
		
		\vspace{5mm}
		
		No free lunch theorem (idea): no machine learning algorithm is universally any better than any other.
	\end{frame}

	\begin{frame}
		\frametitle{Learning algorithm}
		A machine learning algorithm, in brief \textbf{learning algorithm}, is an algorithm that is able to learn from data.
		
		\vspace{5mm}
		
		Based on: data, task and model.
		
		\vspace{5mm}
		
		To evaluate the abilities of a learning algorithm, we must design a quantitative measure of its performance. Usually this performance measure \textit{P} is speciﬁc to the task being carried out by the system.
		
		\vspace{5mm}
		
		The performance measure is called \textsl{cost function} (or \textsl{loss function}).
		
		\vspace{5mm}
		
		Example: a performance measure for the classification tasks is the \textbf{accuracy}. Accuracy is just the proportion of examples for which the model produces the correct output.
