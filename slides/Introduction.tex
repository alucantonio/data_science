		\begin{itemize}
			\item Arthur Samuel (1959). Machine learning is a “Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed”. \pause
			\item Tom Mitchell (1998). “A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.”
